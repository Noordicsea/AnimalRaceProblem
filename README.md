# AnimalRaceProblem
A calculator to calculate a rabbit and turtle race.

For questions like:

A wildebeest and a chicken participate in a race over a 2.20 km long course. The wildebeest travels at a speed of 19.0 m/s and the chicken can do 3.30 m/s. The wildebeest runs for 1.760 km and then stops to tease the slow-moving chicken, which eventually passes by. The wildebeest waits for a while after the chicken passes and then runs toward the finish line. Both animals cross the finish line at the exact same instant. Assume both animals, when moving, move steadily at their respective speeds. 

OR

A lion and a pig participate in a race over a 2.10 km long course. The lion travels at a speed of 19.0 m/s and the pig can do 2.70 m/s. The lion runs for 1.680 km and then stops to tease the slow-moving pig, which eventually passes by. The lion waits for a while after the pig passes and then runs toward the finish line. Both animals cross the finish line at the exact same instant. Assume both animals, when moving, move steadily at their respective speeds.
